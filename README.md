The Clicky Game is a memory game written with React. 

When the user clicks an image, it starts the game. Everytime an image is clicked, the images are shuffled in a random order. The application keeps track and increments the user's score. The score is reset to zero and restarts the game if they click the same image more than once. 

If newScore is greater than the current topScore, newScore is the new topScore.
